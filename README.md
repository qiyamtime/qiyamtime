# Qiyam & Prayer Times

A simple web page that helps you see today’s Islamic prayer times along with the late-night **Qiyam (last third of the night)** window.

🔗 **Live site:** https://qiyamtimes.github.io/

---

## What it shows

- **Daily salah times** — Fajr, Dhuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, and ‘Isha.
- **Qiyam window** — the last third of the night, often recommended for night prayer.
  - _Typical definition:_  
    - **Night length** = time from **Maghrib** to **Fajr**  
    - **Qiyam start** ≈ Maghrib + (2/3 × night length)  
    - **Qiyam end** = Fajr

> Note: Exact calculations and methods can vary by convention; this page presents a straightforward, at-a-glance view.

## Accuracy & methods

Prayer time calculations depend on:
- Your **location** (latitude/longitude)
- The **prayer calculation method** (e.g. Moonsighting Committe, Umm Al-Quara Universtiy, Makkah)
